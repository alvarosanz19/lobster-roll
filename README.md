# lobster-roll
Interactive Max Patch which involves 3D objects dancing on the screen, the user has control over color, speed, size, appearance and over-all look of the patch, among other things. The reason for the name is because I originally used an OBJ. File of a lobster that I created in Maya, but it could take any other OBJ. File of personal preference.
