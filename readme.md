# lobster-roll
Interactive Max Patch which involves 3D objects dancing on the screen, the user has control over color, speed, size, angle of vision, appearance and over-all look of the patch, among other things. 
The original Patch is called jit.mo and it can be found in the Package Manager. Once you find and open this patch, it'll give you the a list of different paths to take, to get to the one I used you'll have to click on "Audiovisuals".
The reason for the name is because I originally used an .OBJ File of a lobster that I created in Maya. It could take any other .OBJ File of personal preference, the original patch included a list of 3D objects to use such as cubes, bubbles etc.
My roll after finding this patch has been to unleash a litle bit more the potential that it originally had, and investigate or discover little things that can make it more user friendly, and more fun to use.
